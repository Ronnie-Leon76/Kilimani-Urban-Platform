# Dynamic Analytics and Functional Buttons Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented real database-driven analytics in the Government Dashboard, made all "View" and "Action" buttons functional across both Government and Admin dashboards, and extended the Admin Dashboard with comprehensive user role management capabilities.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Government Dashboard Analytics (`/components/government-dashboard.tsx`)

#### Report Trends Section (Now Dynamic):
- **Weekly Reports**: Now shows real change percentage from `dashboardData.stats.totalReports.change` instead of hardcoded "+23%"
- **Progress Bar**: Dynamically calculated based on actual total reports count
- **Resolution Rate**: Calculated from real data: `(resolvedThisMonth / totalReports) * 100`
- **Avg Response Time**: Now displays real average response time from `dashboardData.analytics.avgResponseTime`

#### Issue Distribution Section (Now Dynamic):
- **Water Issues**: `(WATER_SHORTAGE count / totalReports) * 100`
- **Infrastructure**: `(INFRASTRUCTURE count / totalReports) * 100`  
- **Flooding**: `(FLOODING count / totalReports) * 100`
- **Waste Management**: `(WASTE_MANAGEMENT count / totalReports) * 100`

All percentages are now calculated from real database data using `dashboardData.analytics.typeDistribution`.

### 2. Functional Buttons Implementation

#### Government Dashboard Buttons:
- **View Button**: `handleViewReport(reportId)` - Shows alert with report ID (can be extended to modal)
- **Action Button**: `handleTakeAction(reportId, currentStatus)` - Updates report status:
  - PENDING → IN_PROGRESS
  - IN_PROGRESS → RESOLVED  
  - RESOLVED → Shows "already resolved" message
- **Status Updates**: Uses PATCH `/api/reports/[id]` endpoint to update database
- **Auto-refresh**: Reloads page after successful status update

#### Admin Dashboard Buttons:
- **View Button**: `handleViewReport(reportId)` - Shows detailed report information
- **Edit Button**: `handleEditReport(reportId)` - Opens edit interface (extensible)
- **Delete Button**: `handleDeleteReport(reportId)` - Deletes report with confirmation
- **Permissions**: Only admins can delete reports

### 3. New API Endpoint (`/app/api/reports/[id]/route.ts`)
- **GET**: Retrieve individual report details
- **PATCH**: Update report status, priority, resolution date
- **DELETE**: Remove report (admin only)
- **Permissions**: Government officials and admins can update; only admins can delete
- **Validation**: Proper status validation and error handling

### 4. **NEW: Advanced User Role Management System**

#### New User Management API (`/app/api/admin/users/[userId]/route.ts`):
- **GET**: Retrieve detailed user information including reports count and recent activity
- **PATCH**: Update user roles and permissions with comprehensive validation
- **DELETE**: Remove users and their associated data (with transaction safety)
- **Security**: Prevents admins from modifying their own roles or deleting themselves
- **Role Validation**: Ensures only valid roles (ADMIN, GOVERNMENT_OFFICIAL, RESIDENT) are assigned

#### Enhanced Admin Dashboard User Management:
- **Real Database Data**: Users list now shows actual system users from database
- **Interactive Role Updates**: Dropdown selectors for instant role changes
- **User Details Modal**: Comprehensive user information dialog with:
  - User profile information and statistics

- **User Deletion**: Safe user removal with cascading deletion of associated reports
- **Security Safeguards**: Cannot modify own role or delete own account
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: All destructive actions require explicit confirmation
- **Real-time Updates**: Dashboard refreshes automatically after role changes

### 5. Database Integration Enhancements

#### Government API (`/app/api/dashboard/government/route.ts`) already provides:
- `typeDistribution`: Report counts by type (WATER_SHORTAGE, INFRASTRUCTURE, etc.)

- **Comprehensive Reports**: Recent reports requiring admin attention

### 6. User Interface Improvements
- **Enhanced Button Styling**: Better hover effects, scaling animations
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during data fetching
